/**
 * Bearer API-key authentication for Fastify — the calling-backend key, not an end user's session
 * or JWT (those stay entirely local; nothing about login, tokens or passwords moves here). Thin
 * wrapper over service-core's `ApiKeyAuth`: `decorate` attaches `request.apiKeyId`, `apiKeyRole`
 * and `apiKeyScopes`, `identify()` keeps returning the id string.
 *
 * Stage 4 adds a role (`read`/`write`/`readwrite`, default `readwrite` — every key from before
 * Stage 4, plain `id:secret`, keeps its full access unchanged) and one flag, `proxy`. Only a handful
 * of clearly back-office mutations (`register`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`) are gated by role today
 * — this is deliberately narrow, not a full read/write split across every route, since most routes
 * here proxy an end user's own action (login, refresh, password reset, …) and "read-only" has no
 * sensible meaning for them. `proxy` gates something unrelated to role: whether the key is trusted
 * to set `X-Client-IP` for the audit log (see `isProxyTrusted`) — a key without it gets `request.ip`
 * regardless of role.
